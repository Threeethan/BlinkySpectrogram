BlinkySpectrogram
===============

A simple visualizer not unlike a single-line spectrogram or spectrograph, based on the output of an FFT organized into octaves.

Virtual Audio Cables (VAC)
--------------------

For your BlinkyLight to properly read the audio please look into the following software:

- VB-Audio Virtual Cable (Windows) - http://vb-audio.pagesperso-orange.fr/Cable/index.htm
- Soundflower (Mac) - http://code.google.com/p/soundflower/

A good tutorial for setting up your VAC to output to your BlinkyTape is written here:
